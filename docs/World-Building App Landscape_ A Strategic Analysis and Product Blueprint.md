# World-Building App – Condensed Strategy

1. **Market Overview**
   - Fragmented market with no clear leader.
   - Users bounce between:
     - Niche tools: powerful but rigid and complex.
     - General tools: flexible but DIY and high setup effort.
   - Two main user types:
     - Novelists: care about story structure + manuscript integration.
     - TTRPG GMs: care about live play, collaboration, and session tools.

2. **Core Cross-Tool Pain Points**
   - Overwhelming, cluttered UX and steep learning curves.
   - Rigid templates and fields that don’t fit many worlds/workflows.
   - Weak mobile apps and inconsistent cross-device experiences.
   - Friction in collaboration (permissions, real-time editing, player-safe views).
   - Lock-in anxiety due to poor or proprietary export options.
   - Pricing that feels confusing, expensive, or predatory to hobbyists.
   - AI that feels gimmicky, intrusive, or harms continuity and style.

3. **Competitor Patterns & Gaps**
   - **World-building / campaign tools (World Anvil, Kanka, LegendKeeper, etc.)**
     - Pros: rich templates, maps, timelines, campaign tools, communities.
     - Cons: cluttered UIs, steep learning curve, rigidity, confusing tiers.
   - **Author-focused tools (Scrivener, Campfire, Reedsy, etc.)**
     - Pros: manuscript + plot tools, strong for writing workflow.
     - Cons: weak maps/timelines and “world bible” relationships, dated/complex UIs.
   - **General knowledge tools (Notion, Obsidian, OneNote, etc.)**
     - Pros: extremely flexible, customizable, often generous free tiers.
     - Cons: big setup tax, technical learning curve, no native world/TTRPG features.
   - **Production-only tools (Vellum, map-makers, etc.)**
     - Pros: great for final formatting/visuals.
     - Cons: do not solve core world-building and campaign-management workflow.

4. **Key User Segments**
   - **Novelists**
     - Need: character arcs, plot structure, manuscript integration, consistent story bible.
   - **TTRPG GMs**
     - Need: session notes, NPC/quest tracking, calendars, player-safe views, collaboration.
   - Many users wear both hats but are currently forced to juggle multiple tools.

5. **Product Vision**
   - **Core Principles**
     - Unified platform for both writers and GMs.
     - Highly flexible entities and views instead of rigid templates.
     - Clean, fast, user-centered UI with progressive disclosure of complexity.
   - **Experience Goals**
     - Intuitive, uncluttered interface.
     - Robust, offline-first mobile with quick capture that syncs everywhere.
     - Simple but powerful collaboration with clear “player view” mode.
     - Data freedom via one-click exports to open formats (Markdown, JSON, etc.).
   - **AI Philosophy**
     - AI is opt-in and assistive (brainstorming, summarizing, continuity checks).
     - Never overwrites the creator’s style or railroads their vision.

6. **MVP Focus**
   - **Foundational Features**
     - Flexible entity system (custom types + custom fields).
     - Fast cross-linking and global search across all content.
     - Reliable mobile app for capture and in-session reference.
     - Clear collaboration and permissions, especially for player vs GM views.
   - **Primary Early Persona**
     - “Time-poor GM” who needs:
       - Fast setup, reusable content.
       - Easy, spoiler-safe player sharing.
   - **Early Differentiators (Next Layer)**
     - Living Document system that auto-updates references when entities change.
     - Player’s View portal for curated, spoiler-free sharing.

7. **Business & Pricing Strategy**
   - Meaningfully usable free tier:
     - Private worlds and core features, not an artificially tiny sandbox.
   - Simple, transparent paid plans:
     - Few tiers with clear value, no complex feature matrices.
   - Pricing aligned to hobbyists:
     - Affordable entry, with clear upsides for power users, teams, and pro GMs.

8. **Strategic Takeaway**
   - Opportunity for a **unified, flexible, export-friendly world-building app** that:
     - Feels lighter and friendlier than heavy TTRPG tools.
     - Demands less setup than general-purpose tools.
     - Serves both novelists and GMs with tailored views in a single product.
     - Uses ethical, low-friction AI to remove busywork without taking control.
